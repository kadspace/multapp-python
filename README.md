# Multiplication Mastery Prototype

A prototype application exploring gamified mathematics learning with real-time analytics. This project tests whether targeted practice with immediate feedback can improve multiplication skills (5×5 to 9×9).

## Structure

- **main.py** - Application entry point
- **multapp.py** - Game mechanics and UI
- **db_manager.py** - Database and analytics

## Features

- Multiplication problems for 5-9 tables
- Performance tracking via SQLite
- Real-time feedback on progress
- Identification of weak spots

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

**Commands:** Enter numbers to answer, `stats` to view weaknesses, `quit` to exit.
